This enhanced system uses advanced analysis to evaluate student answers based on multiple factors:

- **Semantic Similarity**: How closely the meaning matches the correct answer
- **Concept Coverage**: Which key concepts from the correct answer are included
- **Relationship Analysis**: How well connections between concepts are explained
- **Perspective Analysis**: Whether multiple viewpoints or approaches are presented
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifying misconceptions in student answers

The system supports multiple question types:
- **Text**: Theory questions with written explanations
- **Numerical**: Mathematical problems with numerical answers and tolerance settings
- **Code**: Programming questions with syntax and logic analysis

        electrical path, allowing electrons to move through the conductor. According to Ohm's Law (V = IR), when 
        a potential difference (voltage) is applied across a closed circuit with resistance, it causes electrons 
        to drift from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the power source, resulting in electric 
        current. The switch acts as a control mechanism—open switch means the path is broken, and no current flows; 
        closed switch completes the path, enabling current flow."""

        is off, there's a gap in the track—so the electrons can't go anywhere. But as soon as you flip the switch on, 
        the track is completed, and a kind of invisible push—caused by the battery or power source—starts nudging all 
        the electrons forward through the wire. This push is called voltage, and the movement of electrons is what we 
        call electric current. It's not that electrons from the battery travel all the way to each component instantly—instead, 
        it's more like a domino effect: one pushes the next, and energy is delivered to the whole circuit rapidly, even

                    2. **Concept Coverage** (30%): How many key concepts from the correct answer are present
                    3. **Relationship Analysis** (15%): How well the student explains connections between concepts
                    4. **Perspective Analysis** (20%): How many different perspectives are presented
                    5. **Contradiction Detection**: Penalties for statements that contradict the correct answer

                    This approach evaluates conceptual understanding rather than just text matching.

    This application demonstrates a domain-independent approach to grading that recognizes multiple perspectives and explanatory styles.
    
    The system evaluates student answers based on:
    - Semantic similarity
    - Concept coverage
    - Relationship analysis
    - Multiple perspectives
    - Contradiction detection
    
    It's designed to reward critical thinking and comprehensive understanding rather than just memorization.
